## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The project was created with Python 3.8.2. Best install Anaconda. The follwing
packages are used in the jupyte notebook:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Motivation of this project was to find out which programming language and which
further technologies are the most popular currently among developers. The data
was retrieved from [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
The following questions are posed:

* How many people did take part at the survey 2019 and 2020?
* What is the language most people work with 2020?
* How did the preferences in programming language change over time?
* Is there a correlation between job satisfaction and programming language people work with?

The Jupyter Notebook called 'Survey_Analysis.ipynb' includes the complete
analysis of the data following the CRISP-DM.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The findings are described in my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@leopold.walther/this-data-will-help-you-decide-which-programming-language-to-learn-next-c4a5ec0a6414).

* We saw what programming languages are currently most worked with, JavaScript and HTML/CSS as languages for web development are used more than any other.
* We then looked at the how different programming languages people work with are related to their job satisfaction . This showed that there is no significant correlation, although the percentage of people who work with Python is higher among those who are satisfied with their job.
* Finally, we looked at what programming language the Stack Overflow survey contestants desire to work with in the future. We found that Python took over the lead in 2020 as the most desired language to work with in future.
